Custom Skills in Azure Cognitive Search
Azure Cognitive Search is a cloud search service that provides powerful indexing and querying capabilities. Custom skills allow you to extend the built-in cognitive skills with your own logic to process and enrich data during indexing.

What is a Custom Skill?
A custom skill is a user-defined function that you can integrate into the Azure Cognitive Search enrichment pipeline. This function can perform any custom processing on the data, such as calling external APIs, performing complex calculations, or applying specific business logic.

How Custom Skills Work
Skillset Definition: You define a skillset in Azure Cognitive Search, which is a collection of skills (both built-in and custom) that are applied to your data during indexing.

Data Flow: When data is ingested into Azure Cognitive Search, it flows through the skillset. Each skill in the skillset processes the data and passes the enriched data to the next skill in the pipeline.

Custom Skill Invocation: When the data reaches the custom skill, Azure Cognitive Search makes an HTTP POST request to the endpoint you specified for the custom skill. This endpoint can be an Azure Function, a web API, or any other HTTP service.

Processing Logic: The custom skill processes the input data according to your logic and returns the enriched data in the response.

Enriched Data: The enriched data is then used by subsequent skills in the skillset or directly indexed into the search index.

Use Cases for Custom Skills

Data Transformation: Transform raw data into a more useful format for indexing, such as converting units or normalizing text.

External API Integration: Enrich data by calling external APIs, such as sentiment analysis, translation services, or custom machine learning models.

Complex Calculations: Perform complex calculations that are specific to your business needs, such as scoring or ranking data based on custom criteria.

Metadata Extraction: Extract additional metadata from documents, images, or other data types that are not covered by built-in skills.

Benefits of Custom Skills

Flexibility: Custom skills provide the flexibility to implement any logic that is not covered by built-in skills.

Integration: Easily integrate with other Azure services and external APIs to enhance your data.

Scalability: Custom skills can be deployed as scalable services, ensuring they can handle large volumes of data.

Example Scenario

Imagine you have a collection of documents that contain product reviews. You want to index these documents in Azure Cognitive Search and enrich them with sentiment analysis and custom tags based on specific keywords.


Built-in Skills: Use built-in skills to extract text and perform sentiment analysis.

Custom Skill: Implement a custom skill to analyze the text for specific keywords and add custom tags to the documents.

Skillset: Define a skillset that includes both the built-in skills and your custom skill.

Indexing: When documents are ingested, they flow through the skillset, and the custom skill adds the custom tags to the documents before they are indexed.
